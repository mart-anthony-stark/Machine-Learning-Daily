### Linear Regression

Linear regression is one of the most basic forms of machine learning and is used to predict numeric values.
This section is based on the following documentation: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/estimator/linear

- [California House Price Prediction](https://github.com/mart-anthony-stark/Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning/blob/main/Linear%20Regression/HousePricePrediction.ipynb) - This project includes exploratory data analysis, intensive data visualization, data feature engineering, and selecting features based on the correlation of the features.

- [Simple Linear Regression from Scratch](https://github.com/mart-anthony-stark/Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning/blob/main/Linear%20Regression/LinearRegression_from_Scratch.ipynb) - Simple linear regression is an approach for predicting a response using a single feature. This project does not utilize machine learning libraries aside from computation libraries (numpy and pandas).

- [Stock Price Predictor](https://github.com/mart-anthony-stark/Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning/blob/main/Linear%20Regression/SPP_Research.ipynb) - This project predicts stock prices of natural gas, facebook, and USD-PHP currency using linear regression. The datasets are from yahoo finance library.

### Neural Networks

A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates.

- [Feedforward NN Diabetes dataset](https://github.com/mart-anthony-stark/Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning/blob/main/Neural%20Nets/Feedforward_Diabetes_Research.ipynb) - Feedforward neural network is a type of artificial neural network in which nodes' connections do not form a loop.

### Machine Learning in JavaScript

- [Color Brightness Predictor](https://github.com/mart-anthony-stark/Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning/blob/main/JavaScript/objects.js)

### EDA

In statistics, exploratory data analysis is an approach of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods.
